# 162. Find Peak Element
# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    # not original
    # i cannot do this
    # a smart usage of binary search
    # the key is to find the pattern and then shrink the input until only 1 element left inside [b, e]
